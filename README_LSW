Private files for open social
-----------------------------

Private files are inside the download at private/files - not just private

Added lando specific items to settings.php for the DB and private files.

Need to add drush as a composer requirement for develop - as devshop doesn't like drush9, but we want drush9 on our local version.

lando Composer update may fail with an OOM error.
use :-
lando php -d memory_limit=-1 /usr/local/bin/composer update
